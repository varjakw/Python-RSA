# Python-RSA
RSA implementation in Python with PyCrypto which allows for PKCS#1 padding.


### Quick Note 
Github with PyCharm is a little finnicky. Its best to make the repo first, and then clone it or "Get from VCS" as PyCharm calls it, and then to create your python files inside PyCharm before commit and push.
